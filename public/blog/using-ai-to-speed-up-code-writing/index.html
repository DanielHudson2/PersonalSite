    <h1>Using AI to speed up code writing</h1>
    <time datetime="Fri Mar 24 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)">24th March 2023</time>
    <p>I recently needed to modify a WooCommerce variable product page to output all the variations in a table with an add to basket button. This can of course be achieved using a plugin easily but I needed to pull some specific values in certain places so decided to write it myself.</p>
<p>I saw this as an opportunity to speed up the process using Chat GPT.</p>
<p>On my first few prompts it gave me the basics of what I needed but it kept getting stuck on the add to basket button on each row and I ended up going through several other prompts to get it to understand the context of what I needed (at one point it thought I was trying to do it on the category pages), but it did eventually give me everything I needed.</p>
<p>This didn't necessarily save me much time except in it giving me the basic structure I needed, but with better prompts earlier on it would have at least got me much further along, it's such a powerful tool when being wielded correctly so it's important to take the time to think about exactly what you want from it before you start.</p>
