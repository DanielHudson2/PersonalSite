I recently needed to modify a WooCommerce variable product page to output all the variations in a table with an add to basket button. This can of course be achieved using a plugin easily but I needed to pull some specific values in certain places so decided to write it myself.

I saw this as an opportunity to speed up the process using Chat GPT.

On my first few prompts it gave me the basics of what I needed but it kept getting stuck on the add to basket button on each row and I ended up going through several other prompts to get it to understand the context of what I needed (at one point it thought I was trying to do it on the category pages), but it did eventually give me everything I needed.

This didn't necessarily save me much time except in it giving me the basic structure I needed, but with better prompts earlier on it would have at least got me much further along, it's such a powerful tool when being wielded correctly so it's important to take the time to think about exactly what you want from it before you start.
