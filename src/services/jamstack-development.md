## Static-first development

Jamstack essentially means a static-first site build, the site won't be connected with a traditional CMS or a database.

What this means is that the pages are already put together content and all, this results in faster load times because time doesn't need to be taken to query a database or put various templates together like a traditional CMS.

## Where Jamstack comes in
Traditionally the issue here would have been managing a static website, lots of parts get repeated across files and it gets hard to maintain, Jamstack solves this by introducing static site generators.
A static site generator allows you to break the site into templates and it will then compile it into a static website thats ready to go onto your server.
I use Eleventy and Netlify to achieve this as the two work together seamlessly.

## Managing content
While this sounds like you won't be able to manage your content properly this is not the case.
You can link the site up to a new kind of CMS which still lets you edit and write content for the site, one such example is Decap CMS (formerlly Netlify CMS).
