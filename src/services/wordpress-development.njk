<p>{{ shortDescription }}</p>
<p>WordPress is a highly customisable content management system that can be used for almost any use case from a simple content based site to a ecommerce store selling thousands of products.</p>
<p>You may have heard that it's not secure, but that only really applies when the site isn't maintained, 
    being the most popular content management system in the world means that attackers are always looking for vulnerabilities. 
    The key to avoid this is to keep everything up to date and only use plugins from reputable sources which is what I will do for you.</p>
<p>WordPress is quite resource light (dependant on features and usage of course) which means it can be hosted on almost any shared hosting offerings out there, however my recommendation would always be to use at least a virtual private server (VPS).</p>
